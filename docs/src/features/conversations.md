# Conversations

Conversations are the core feature of Liteskill. Each conversation is an event-sourced stream that records every user message, LLM response, and tool call.

## Creating Conversations

Users create conversations from the main UI. Each conversation has:

- A **title** (auto-generated or user-set)
- A **model** selection (from configured LLM models)
- An optional **system prompt**
- An optional **LLM model** override

## Messaging

When a user sends a message:

1. A `UserMessageAdded` event is appended to the conversation stream
2. The LLM `StreamHandler` starts a streaming response
3. Chunks arrive as `AssistantChunkReceived` events
4. The stream completes with `AssistantStreamCompleted`

## Tool Calling

During streaming, the LLM may request tool calls:

- **Auto-confirm mode**: Tool calls execute automatically via MCP servers
- **Manual mode**: The UI pauses for user approval before executing each tool call

Tool calls are recorded as `ToolCallStarted` and `ToolCallCompleted` events.

## Forking

Conversations can be forked at any message position, creating a new independent conversation with the history up to that point. The fork creates a new event stream with copied events and remapped IDs.

## Sharing

Conversation access is controlled via ACLs:

- The creator is automatically the **owner**
- Owners can grant **manager** access to other users or groups
- Shared conversations appear in the recipient's conversation list

## Archiving

Conversations can be archived individually or in bulk. Archived conversations are hidden from the default list but retain their full event history.

## Stream Recovery

A periodic sweeper (`Liteskill.Chat.StreamRecovery`) detects conversations stuck in streaming state for more than 5 minutes and automatically recovers them by failing the stream.
